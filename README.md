## Downloads

* [Windows Executable](gamewindowsexport)
  * Download Mathrpg.exe and pck.zip, then extract pck.zip and place Mathrpg.exe inside the resulting folder named "pck" (this folder can be safely renamed). Running Mathrpg.exe from inside this folder will run the game.

## Overview

Math RPG is a top-down style RPG game designed to allow students to practice basic math concepts in a fun and interactive way.

After running the executable, press the start button in the main menu to play the game. After a brief cutscene, you will be teleported to the first level.

The first level is a top-down style level. In these levels, use the arrow keys or the d-pad on a controller to move the character around the level. Search the level to find the entrance to the next level, which will teleport you when you walk into it.

The second level is a battle-style level. In these levels, note that the player character is on the left side, an enemy character is on the right side, and both have health bars underneath them. To fight, press one of the buttons, which may be labeled "addition," "subtraction," "multiplication," or "division." When pressed, a pop-up will appear with a randomly generated math question of the type associated with the button you clicked. Answer the question and click "OK." If you got it right, the enemies health will go down! Bring the enemies health to zero to move to the next level. Watch out, though; get it wrong, and your health will go down! When your health reaches zero, you will be sent back to the first level, so be careful!

Different types of math questions do different amounts of damage:

* Addition - 1/2 a heart
* Subtraction - 1 heart
* Multiplication - 1 1/2 hearts
* Division - 2 hearts

Additionally, the more you answer one type of question correctly, the harder that type of question will get! This works both ways; if you answer incorrectly, the questions of that type get easier. Be sure to mix up what type of question you answer!

Complete all levels to win the game! Good luck!
